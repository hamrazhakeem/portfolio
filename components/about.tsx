  <p className="mb-3">
    I'm <span className="font-medium">Hamraz Hakeem</span>, a self-taught <span className="font-medium">Full Stack Developer</span> passionate about building scalable solutions. My journey wasn't traditionalâ€”I started with a <span className="font-medium">BBA</span> before leaving college to pursue software development at <span className="font-medium">Brototype</span>, where I transformed my passion into expertise.
  </p>

  <p className="mb-3">
    At Brototype, I built two major projects: an <span className="font-medium">E-commerce Platform</span> with authentication and payments, and a microservices-based <span className="font-medium">Booking Application</span> for session scheduling. Through these and other mini projects, I mastered <span className="font-medium">Python, Django, React, PostgreSQL, Docker, and Kubernetes</span>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I thrive on continuous learning and solving complex challenges. I'm passionate about writing clean, scalable code and building efficient systems. I'm currently seeking <span className="font-medium">Full Stack Developer</span> roles where I can contribute to innovative projects, collaborate with skilled teams, and further enhance my expertise in software development.
